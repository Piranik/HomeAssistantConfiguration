# My Home Assistant Configuration

This [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) configuration is based on [configuration by Isabella Gross Alstr√∂m](https://isabellaalstrom.github.io/).

Like the Isabella I'm using the GitHub [issues](https://github.com/Limych/hassio-config/issues) and [project](https://github.com/Limych/hassio-config/projects/1) to keep track of bugs in my configuration and new features I want to make/use.

## Organizing the configuration

This configuration is broken down into [packages](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/packages/), sort of mini configuration-files. This makes it easy to see everything pertaining to a specific implementation.

But while using packages you can no longer reload your config with the buttons in the ui.

## Ecosystem

Now I have very few devices in the system. But I plan to gradually add new ones.

Now I am running Hass.io on my FreeNAS server into Bhyve virtual machine which emulates Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ 32bit.

## Lovelace

I'm using yaml mode, with includes.

My main Lovelace-file is found [here](https://github.com/Limych/hassio-config/blob/master/ui-lovelace.yaml), and my folder with includes [here](https://github.com/Limych/hassio-config/tree/master/lovelace). This is very much still a work in progress, so files might not correspond exactly to screenshots.

I put a lot of work into making this repo available and updated to inspire and help others!

### Examples from my Lovelace GUI

I have tried to make a GUI that is mobile first, since that's how I most often look at it.

Click on the images to get to the corresponding YAML-file.
